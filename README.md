# In a nutshell:

Please fork this repo and then use a common IaC tool to host the content in `web/` on AWS and password protect the hosted site

We anticipate this will take about two hours. If you're still working on it after two hours please stop and send us what you have. This is more about seeing how you approach the problem

You have full access to `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`. Credentials should have been provided separately. You can generate as many as you want but those expire after an hour. If you plug them into `credentials.sh` you'll get credentials back that don't expire

---
### Your solution should:

- Be reusable. It should be possible to apply it to any AWS account and GitHub repo with the necessary credentials
- Automatically update the webpage when it’s changed in the repo
- Consider maintainability. The less maintenance it’ll require in the future, the better
- Be fully automated with no steps that need to be completed in the console
- Take security into account. Security is hard and your solution doesn’t need to be perfect. It’s ok to take some shortcuts if you call out what you’d do in production to make it safer
- Be inexpensive

---
### Deliverables:

- A URL that can be accessed from the internet and prompts for a username and password
	- It’s fine if the URL contains an AWS-owned domain or an IP. After authenticating, the site in `web/` is displayed by a web browser
- Username and password that we can use to authenticate
- Link to the forked repo containing your solution
- A README with a brief explanation of your solution and anything else you’d like us to know

**Please be prepared to talk about your solution and to help troubleshoot if we can’t make it work**

### Extras:

Some basic scaffolding you may find useful is included but please feel free to use other tools if you prefer

We don't expect you to write the auth stuff. There are lots of examples on GitHub if you'd like to use one of those. [For example](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jeroenvollenbrock/94edbbc62adc986d6d6a9a3076e66f5b/raw/259840af8dc2408f2be142588e41aebfa76c44b7/aws-cloudfront-basic-auth.js)
